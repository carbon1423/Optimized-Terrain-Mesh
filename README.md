# Optimized Terrain Generation:

## Goals for this Project:

- Generate Multiple chunks of procedural terrain
- Optimize chunk loading to improve frame rate
- Learn about terrain generation and infinite chunks

## Current Progress:

- Load GLFW and OpenGL

## Next Steps:

- Create chunk and mesh classes
- create multiple flat chunks (eventually adding perlin noise)
